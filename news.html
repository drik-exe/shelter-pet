            <p style="width: 86%; margin:  0px 0px 50px 0px;">Almost every day we receive new four-legged guests - abandoned or lost pets. Our task is to provide them with temporary shelter, food, veterinary care and diligently find new loving families. The process of adopting animals is always very touching moments when cute creatures find a long-awaited home.<br><br>  
                The shelter regularly hosts various educational campaigns and events for local residents. We talk about the importance of a responsible attitude towards pets, their proper maintenance and care. Volunteer activities are actively carried out - people help walk, feed and play with the shelter residents.<br><br>
                In addition, we are active on social networks, publishing photos and videos of our charges, sharing positive stories about their adoption into families. This helps to find new owners and attract public attention to the current problems of homeless animals.
