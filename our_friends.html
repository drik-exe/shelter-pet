                <p style="font-size: 2vh">Every day, dozens of animals become homeless, some were thrown out, some got lost, some were born on the street... Each of them has their own story. Among them are those who were lucky enough to be on the volunteer path. They were taken from the lonely streets and from that moment every minute of their lives began to change. However, the biggest dream of each of our charges is a caring and loving owner, a warm home, and confidence in the future. Taking in a stray dog ​​or cat is a big responsibility, but at the same time, it is a great happiness that you can share with each other for many years. By taking one of them, you save a life!</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2vh">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show that only 20% of them will 
                    find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.We 
                    feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. <br><br>
                    We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. 
                    Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
